This code-based toolkit was built to overcome the limits of Gutenberg Block and WP Shortcode when using AI coding assistants in WordPress hybrid themes. It provides a simple, AI-friendly way to generate elements like 'Post Card' and 'Post Cards Group'. Implemented as a mu-plugin for theme independence and easy management across projects.
