# uq-blog-kit
This library was built to tackle real-world problems I faced when setting up several corporate and community blogs. It started out as a personal project, and as a targeted, temporary fix, it uses some unconventional methods.

Working with AI coding assistants like Claude in hybrid themes like GeneratePress, I kept running into the limitations of standard Gutenberg blocks, WordPress templates, and shortcodes. This toolkit is a simple, code-based solution that brings together the best features of those methods, allowing you to generate elements like 'Post Cards' and 'Posts Groups' in a way that's easy for an AI to work with.

It's also implemented as a Must-Use plugin (mu-plugin) to minimize dependency on any specific theme and make it easier to manage across multiple ongoing projects.
